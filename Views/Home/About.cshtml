<p>
    When I'm not reading or coding for this class, I like to live a pretty laid back life.
    <br />
    <br />
    Since its cold out, I stay inside and play EA NHL a little too much but I win a lot so that's pretty cool.
    <br />
    <br />
    Summertime is definitely my favorite season though because of all of the outdoor activities. I'm a pretty active person so
    I can partake in any sport, but recently since taking a golf class at OU, golf has my interest.
    <br />
    <br />
    Eventually I'd like to travel in life but that's after I make money building these =)
